The line chart illustrates average carbon dioxide (CO2) emission**s** per person in the four countries from 1967 to 1007.

Overall, **the amount of** CO2 emissions **produced/created** ~~decreased~~ in the United Kingdom and Sweden **by an average person showed a downward trend** during 40 years, ~~while~~**whereas** the figure for Italy and Portugal increased. It can also be seen that, between 1967 and 2007, the emission in United Kingdom and Portugal were highest and lowest in the four countries, respectively.

**There was an upward trend in the amount of ...**

**During 40-year period**

**The amount of emissions produced by British people remained the largest throughout the period**

Average carbon dioxide emissions per person dropped gradually in the United Kingdom from 1967 to 2007, ~~moving~~**decreasing** from around 11 **metric tonnes** to 9 metric tonnes. Meanwhile, the emissions in Sweden grew before 1977 from about 9 **metric tonnes** to over 10 **metric tonnes**, then declined significantly to almost 6 **metric tonnes** in 2007.

**Before the figure to Sweden saw a significant decline a around 6 metric tonnes in 2007, it peaked at almost 11 in 1977**
**it increased sharply in the first decade, increasing from about 9 metric tonnes**

The ~~emission curve~~**amount of emmisions** climbed dramatically for Portugal, rising from 1 to almost 6 metric tonnes, over 40 years. And the figure for Italy went up remarkably from over 4 to almost 8 **metric tonnes**, with overtaking Sweden in 1987 **becoming the country with the second largest amount of CO2 amount**.

The table illustrates the proportion of main expenditure categories in the British family between 1978 and 2003.

**The proportion of British household expenditure on five different aspects**

Overall, ~~the amount of~~**The percentage of** living expenses of British households remained the largest throughout the period. And, there were two upward trends in the amount of Fuel and Leisure.

**There was a downward trend in the percentage of British family spending on food and drink, whereas other categories saw opposite trend.**

**The percentage of British family spending on food&drink was 25%.**
**British family spent/paid out 25% of their expenditure on food&drink.**
**Food and drink costed British family 25% of their expenditure.**
**Money spent on food and drink accounterd for 25% of British family's total expenditure.**

The percentage of living spending in British household rose gradually during the 25-year period, ~~moving~~**increasing** from 36 percent to 40 percent. Meanwhile, the figure ~~of~~**for** ~~UK family spending on~~ ~~F~~fuel increased slightly from 10 percent **to 13 percent** and then remained stable ~~at 13 percent~~, as well as those of Leisure went up relatively significantly from 7 percent to 15 percent. (double)

**For leisure, the figure doubled from 7 percent in 1988 to 15 percent 1998, before it peaked at  15 percent in 2003.**

By contrast, before the proportion of expenditure for ~~C~~**c**lothing saw a moderate ~~climbed~~**rise** ~~of~~**to** 10% in 2003, the ~~data~~**figure** declined to its lowest (7 percent) in 1993. It can also be seen that~~,~~ the figure for Food&Drink decreased considerably, dropping from 25 percent to 17 percent.

The pie charts illustrate the proportion of energy produced/**created/generated** from five different sources in two separate years.

Overall, the percentage of energy created from Oil remained **the** highest throughout the period, although it decreased significantly from 1995 to 2003. It can also be seen that~~,~~ there ~~were~~**was** ~~four~~**an** upward trend~~s~~ in the ~~amount~~**proportions** of energy produced from ~~N~~**n**uclear, ~~C~~**c**oal, ~~H~~**h**ighdrop and ~~O~~**o**ther sources ~~except Oil~~.

The proportion of energy produced by Oil **decreased** from over **a** half (almost 60 percent) to just below 40 percent, however **,** it remained the most popular source of energy ~~produced~~**production**. Meanwhile, the figure for ~~O~~**o**ther sources ~~exccept Nuclear, Coal, Highdrop~~ ~~totally~~ remain**ed** steady ~~around 3 percent or 4 percent~~ **at below 5 percent**.

By contrast, the **percentages of energy produced** other sources of energy produced ~~relatively~~ grew remarkably, among which the percentage of Nuclear went up dramatically from 23 percent to 31 percent, **accounting for** about one-third of the total energy produced. Although the percentage**s** of energy produced by Coal and Highdrop was ~~less~~**significantly lower** than **those of** Nuclear and Oil, ~~it's~~ **it is** also worth ~~for us to~~ notic~~e~~**ing that** the upward trend~~s~~ of them, which ~~account for~~**the percentage of** Coal increased from 8 percent to 12 percent, and the figure for Highdrop doubled from 7 percent to 14 percent.

The table presents the proportion of ~~items~~**spending/consumption** ~~that national consumers spent~~ on **three different aspects in five separate countries** ~~in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Turkey~~ in 2002.

Overall, ~~most of~~ people in five different countries spent most of money on ~~eating or drink, like Foods, Drinks or Tobacco~~**food, drinks and tobacco**. By contrast, expenditure on leisure ~~or~~**and** education ~~is~~**was the** lowest for all countries.

The percentage of national consumer expenditure on eating ~~remained stable highest than all of other categories~~ was the highest. Consumers in Ireland and Turkey ~~spending~~**spent** approximately one-third **of their income** on it, and the figure**s** for other three countries ~~was~~**were relatively smaller** ~~less~~ than those two, among which account for around 17 percent (about half of Turkey).

**People in Sweden spent the smallest percentage of their income on this category, at only 15.77 percent**

The proportion of consumer spending on clothing or footwear ~~is~~**was** significantly lower than **those of** foods or drinks, none of the five different countries more than one-tenth. It can also be seen that~~,~~ the expenses on leisure or education in those countries, the figure is lowest of all categories around 3 percent.

**Sweden had the lowest percentage of consumption for clothing and footwear, at just over 5%.**
