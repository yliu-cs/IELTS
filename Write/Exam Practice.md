The line chart illustrates average carbon dioxide (CO2) emission**s** per person in the four countries from 1967 to 1007.

Overall, **the amount of** CO2 emissions **produced/created** ~~decreased~~ in the United Kingdom and Sweden **by an average person showed a downward trend** during 40 years, ~~while~~**whereas** the figure for Italy and Portugal increased. It can also be seen that, between 1967 and 2007, the emission in United Kingdom and Portugal were highest and lowest in the four countries, respectively.

**There was an upward trend in the amount of ...**

**During 40-year period**

**The amount of emissions produced by British people remained the largest throughout the period**

Average carbon dioxide emissions per person dropped gradually in the United Kingdom from 1967 to 2007, ~~moving~~**decreasing** from around 11 **metric tonnes** to 9 metric tonnes. Meanwhile, the emissions in Sweden grew before 1977 from about 9 **metric tonnes** to over 10 **metric tonnes**, then declined significantly to almost 6 **metric tonnes** in 2007.

**Before the figure to Sweden saw a significant decline a around 6 metric tonnes in 2007, it peaked at almost 11 in 1977**
**it increased sharply in the first decade, increasing from about 9 metric tonnes**

The ~~emission curve~~**amount of emmisions** climbed dramatically for Portugal, rising from 1 to almost 6 metric tonnes, over 40 years. And the figure for Italy went up remarkably from over 4 to almost 8 **metric tonnes**, with overtaking Sweden in 1987 **becoming the country with the second largest amount of CO2 amount**.

The table illustrates the proportion of main expenditure categories in the British family between 1978 and 2003.

Overall, the amount of living spending of British household remained the largest throughout the period. And, there were two upward trends in the amount of Fuel and Leisure.

The percentage of spending of living in British household rose gradually during 25-year period, moving from 36 percent to 40 percent. Meanwhile, the figure of UK family spending on Fuel increased slightly from 10 percent and then remained stable at 13%, as well as those of Leisure went up relatively significantly from 7 percent to 15 percent. (double)

Before the proportion of expenditure for Clothing saw a moderately climbed 10% in 2003, the data declined at lowest (7%) in 1993. It can also be seen that the figure for Food&Drink decreased considerably, dropping from 25% to 17%.

The pie charts illustrates the proportion of energy produced from five separate sources between 1995 and 2003.

Overall, the percentage of energy created from Oil remained highest throughout the period, although it decreased significantly from 1995 to 2003. It also can be seen that, there were four upward trends in the amount of energy produced from Nuclear, Coal, Highdrop and Other sources.
The proportion of energy produced by Oil from over half (almost 60 percent) to just below 40 percent, it remain the most popular source of energy produced.
