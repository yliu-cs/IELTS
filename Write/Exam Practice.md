The table illustrates the proportion of main expenditure categories in the British family between 1978 and 2003.

**The proportion of British household expenditure on five different aspects**

Overall, ~~the amount of~~**The percentage of** living expenses of British households remained the largest throughout the period. And, there were two upward trends in the amount of Fuel and Leisure.

**There was a downward trend in the percentage of British family spending on food and drink, whereas other categories saw opposite trend.**

**The percentage of British family spending on food&drink was 25%.**
**British family spent/paid out 25% of their expenditure on food&drink.**
**Food and drink costed British family 25% of their expenditure.**
**Money spent on food and drink accounterd for 25% of British family's total expenditure.**

The percentage of living spending in British household rose gradually during the 25-year period, ~~moving~~**increasing** from 36 percent to 40 percent. Meanwhile, the figure ~~of~~**for** ~~UK family spending on~~ ~~F~~fuel increased slightly from 10 percent **to 13 percent** and then remained stable ~~at 13 percent~~, as well as those of Leisure went up relatively significantly from 7 percent to 15 percent. (double)

**For leisure, the figure doubled from 7 percent in 1988 to 15 percent 1998, before it peaked at  15 percent in 2003.**

By contrast, before the proportion of expenditure for ~~C~~**c**lothing saw a moderate ~~climbed~~**rise** ~~of~~**to** 10% in 2003, the ~~data~~**figure** declined to its lowest (7 percent) in 1993.

* Some people who have been successful in society don’t attribute their success to the theoretical knowledge they learned from their university.
* Do you agree that theoretical knowledge is not as valuable as expected?

Nowadays, more and more young people graduate, and then they start their first job in society. However, whether the theoretical knowledge students learned in universit~~y~~**ies** can lead them to success is a controversial issue. I agree with that theories ~~is~~**are** not as valuable as most people expected.

It is obvious that most majors require a lot of practice and internship experiences before entering the workforce in society, especially ~~type of~~ engineering. Such as software engineering, companies recruit graduates to develop applications in variety of areas, this ~~work need~~**requires** employee to code the whole program to construct the application. In this scenario, theoretical knowledge is insufficient for people to finish the real work. Thus, practice is more important than theories ~~learning~~.

~~On top of that~~ **Furthermore/Moreover, it can also be argue that** the theoretical knowledge that students learned from books in **the** university was easy to be out of date. There is a long run for publication about theories, but it is necessary for students to find a good job by following the ~~newest~~**latest/cutting edge** technology. Therefore, students learn more about their major from the internet instead of books in class.

It seems to be a concern that some ex-prisoners commit crimes after being released from the prison. There are several causes of this trend, but measures could be taken to tackle the problem.

There are two main reasons that are responsible for **recidivism**. One important factor contributing to this phenomenon is that ex-prisoners ~~commit crimes under~~**suffer from** discrimination and **a** lack of skills to ~~work in society~~**get a job** after being released from the prison. It is necessary for people to get legitimate source of income for mak~~e~~**ing** a living ~~by working~~, but it is hard for them to re-ent~~ry~~**er** ~~into~~ the society with ~~stereotype to find a job~~ **labels**. Another reason account**s** for this trend is poverty trap. Living in previous community after serving a prison sentence, the terrible environment exposed ex-prisoners to a life of crime, so they fall in the poverty trap and cannot get away from this kind of life. Therefore, some ex-prisoners commit crimes again.

Both the government and society should be actively involved to prevent the ex-prisoners re-commit crimes. The government should ~~release~~**publish/make** some policies to deter~~rent~~ crimes and strength**en** the ~~mental~~ education **program** for prisoners in prison. Besides, it is important to make publicity the effect of rehabilitation in prison, which can decrease the stereotype of people. Furthermore, ~~prison managers can construct a~~ re-entry program **should be designed to** ~~that~~ provide vocational training ~~for prisoners~~ to teach them work skills **For example, they may lack the interview skills to be hired for a position.** to increase the chances of get**iing** new job ~~after~~**upon** release.

**facilitate programs to help individuals to make positive community relationship so that ...**

In conclusion, there are two main reasons for some ex-prisoners ~~make~~**re-commit** crimes ~~again after release~~ about social stigma and poverty trap. Therefore, the government and society should make publicity of rehabilitation and provide vocational training for them to prevent relevant consequences.

**In conclusion, social stigma and poverty trap are two major factors to be blamed for recidivism**
**Lacking of legitimate source of income and coming from a poor neighbourhood which can potentially lead to recidivism**

* Some people suggest that young adults should be encouraged to do some unpaid work for a period of time for the community to help people.
* Does it bring more benefits or drawbacks to the community and the young people?

Nowadays, more and more youth are encouraged to do some free work for community t~~o help others~~. However, whether ~~the~~ young people do some unpaid work bring more benefits is a controversial issue. I agree with that ~~youth freely~~ help**ing** people can bring benefits to themselves and **the** society.

**Whether this can benefit both young people and community is a controversial issue**
**they shoud be motivated to do some unpaid community work**

It is obvious that more and more people are socializing less than before, the ~~relationship~~**connection** between people and **their** neighbour~~hood~~s are decreasing now. Thus, ~~it~~**helping others** is a simple but effective way for young people ~~to help others~~ to make new friends in **the** community, ~~then~~**and therefore** they could bond with each other ~~during the association~~**by coming together and working collaboratively**. The people who helped others can receive feedback of helping from them, it is an essential part of a friendly community.

**plays a vital role in improving the connection among people in the community**
**Volunteering their time and effort can help them get more involved in the community to make the community friendiler**

Furthermore, it can also be argue**d** that helping neighbour~~hood~~s is not just a form of work but more of a leisure activity for young people. Because they can release themselves from the heavy work when they helping others after daily work, it is important for society to full of energy. Besides, people also get a sense of achievement and inner satisfaction by helping others, it is a valuable experience of improvement.

**Expand skill sets - provide opportunities for students to tackle problems and challenges which are hard to get in the school environment**
**For example, raise funds for charities**
**Helping senior citizens in the community - patiently**
**prepare them for more complex communication scnarios/situations in the future, especially when they enter the workforce and need to interact with colleagues coming from different backgrounds**

On the other hand, although it is cost-consuming for young people to do unpaid work to help others rather than focu~~s~~**ing** on their work or study, they can get more than money in other aspects, such as contacts, inner feeling and so on.

**a sense of achievement/responsibility - by helping people in need**
**make a positive impact to their lives**

In conclusion, young people doing some unpaid work can bring benefits ~~like~~**such as** making new friends and being more relax. Therefore, I argue that young adults should ~~freely~~ do some **free** work for a period of time for the community to help others.

The line chart illustrates the proportion of people visiting the gym at least once a month in four different age groups from 1984 to 2003.

Overall, There are three upward trend of the percentage of people visiting the gym once a month or more during the period. Meanwhile, the figure for 46-65 age group decreased rapidly after rise.

The proportion of people under 25 age went to gym every month increased significantly, moving from around 15 percent to almost 60 percent, it maintain the highest since 1994 by overtaking those of 26-45 age and 46-65 group. It can also be seen that the figure for 26-45 age group showed more variation from 1984 to 1994, then sharply went up and peaked at approximately 55 percent in 2003.

The percentage of above 65 age people monthly went to gym climbed gradually with a fluctuation, moving from 5 percent to 20 percent between 1984 and 2003.

* Printed book is not necessary in digital era, books can stored in electronically, others believe that printed books will continue to play an important part in our lives.
* Discuss both views and your opinions.

Nowadays, more and more people read electronic book rather than printed book. especially young people. However, whether printed book will continue to play its vital role in digital era is a controversial issue. I agree with that book with paper material is not essential with the development of electronic technology.

It is obvious that e-book is more convenient for people to read than printed book. It is a easier method for people to choose a book that they want to read with just one iPad or mobile phone everywhere, they do not carry a lot of printed book any more. For example, people have to carry three printed books during their journey if they want to read all of them, but they can read more then three e-books with only one iPad.

Moreover, it can also be argue that e-book is friendly to our natural environment than paper book. Producing a printed book require a lot of paper from harvesting trees, it is really waste of the natural resources. It is hard for us to maintain the health of our living environment. But procedure for creating digital book without any natural resources is more friendly to our environment, it is important for us to develop technology sustainable.

Although printed book with unique layout of image and text in each of them could provide a special reading experience, e-book could offer the same or even better with the improvement of technology. We can read e-book with their own layout in file format of pdf or epub.

In conclusion, the e-book is more convenient and environment-friendly for people to read than printed book. Therefore, I argue that printed book is not necessary in digital era.
