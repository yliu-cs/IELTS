The line chart illustrates average carbon dioxide (CO2) emission**s** per person in the four countries from 1967 to 1007.

Overall, **the amount of** CO2 emissions **produced/created** ~~decreased~~ in the United Kingdom and Sweden **by an average person showed a downward trend** during 40 years, while the figure for Italy and Portugal increased. It can also be seen that, between 1967 and 2007, the emission in United Kingdom and Portugal were highest and lowest in the four countries, respectively.

**There was  an upward trend in the amount of ...**

**During 40-year period**

**The amount of emissions produced by British people remained the largest throughout the period**

Average carbon dioxide emissions per person dropped gradually in the United Kingdom from 1967 to 2007, ~~moving~~**decreasing** from around 11 **metric tonnes** to 9 metric tonnes. Meanwhile, the emissions in Sweden grew before 1977 from about 9 **metric tonnes** to over 10 **metric tonnes**, then declined significantly to almost 6 **metric tonnes** in 2007.

**Before the figure to Sweden saw a significant decline a around 6 metric tonnes in 2007, it peaked at almost 11 in 1977**
**it increased sharply in the first decade, increasing from about 9 metric tonnes**

The ~~emission curve~~**amount of emmisions** climbed dramatically for Portugal, rising from 1 to almost 6 metric tonnes, over 40 years. And the figure for Italy went up remarkably from over 4 to almost 8 **metric tonnes**, with overtaking Sweden in 1987 **becoming the country with the second largest amount of CO2 amount**.
