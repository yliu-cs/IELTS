		* John Willis wanted _Cutty Sark_ to be the fastest tea clipper travelling between the UK and China.
			* Willis's company was active in the tea trade between China and Britain, where speed could bring shipowners both profits and prestige, so _Cutty Sark_ was designed to make the journey more quickly than any other ship.
		* Despite storm damage, Cutty Sark beat Thermopylae back to London.
			* On one occasion, in 1872, the ship and a rival clipper, Thermopylae, left port in China on the same day. Crossing the Indian Ocean, Cutty Sark gained a lead of over 400 miles, but then her rudder was severely damaged in stormy seas, making her impossible to steer. The ship's crew had the daunting task of repairing the rudder at sea, and only succeeded at the second attempt. Cutty Sark reached London a week after Thermopylae.
		* Steam ships sometimes used the ocean route to travel between London and China.
		* Captain Woodget put Cutty Sark at risk of hitting an iceberg.
			* As a sailing ship, _Cutty Sark_ depended on the strong trade winds of the southern hemisphere, and Woodget took her further south than any previous captain, bringing her dangerously close to icebergs off the southern tip of South America. His gamble paid off, though, and the ship was the fastest vessel in the wool trade for ten years.
