From talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home.

This is the gallery that attracts the largest number of visitors, so it's best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive.

		* What mistake was made when building water drainage channels in Miami in the 1950s?
			* They did not allow for the effects of climate change.
				* 考点
					* Yeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them. But what they didn't take into account was global warming. So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level, and now sea levels are rising, they’re more or less useless. If there' s a lot of rain, the water can’t run away, there's nowhere for it to go. The whole design was faulty.
				* 错误原因
					* 同义替换 climate change <-> global warming
		* What do they agree should be the priority for international action?
			* greater coordination of activities
				* 考点
					* Absolutely. The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them, so they should be able to work together to some extent. But it's going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they’re prepared to abide by.
				* 错误原因
					* 同义替换 work together <-> coordination
