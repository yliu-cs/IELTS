The line chart illustrates average carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per person in the four countries from 1967 to 1007.

Overall, CO2 emissions decreased in the United Kingdom and Sweden during 40 years, while the figure for Italy and Portugal increased. It can also be seen that, between 1967 and 2007, the emission in United Kingdom and Portugal were highest and lowest in the four countries, respectively.

Average carbon dioxide emissions per person dropped gradually in the United Kingdom from 1967 to 2007, moving from around 11 to 9 metric tonnes. Meanwhile, the emissions in Sweden grew before 1977 from about 9 to over 10, then declined significantly to almost 6 in 2007.

The emission curve climbed dramatically for Portugal, rising from 1 to almost 6 metric tonnes, over 40 years. And the figure for Italy went up remarkablely from over 4 to almost 8, with overtook Sweden in 1987.
