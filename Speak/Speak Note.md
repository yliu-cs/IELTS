	* Major
		* I am a final-year Master’s student at School of Computer Science & Technology, Soochow University. Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree from School of Software, Henan University
		* The reason for choosing CS as my major is that I was interested in games and wanted to know how to create it
		* My internship experience at NetEase Games as a game developer enabled me to complete the original idea
		* Currently, I focus on exploration of multi-modal understanding & generation, which is the part of AI applications
		* I'm applying for a PhD position to finish my research assumption, and I want to perform Live Esports Narrative Generation via this opportunity
