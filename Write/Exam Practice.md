* Some people who have been successful in society don’t attribute their success to the theoretical knowledge they learned from their university.
* Do you agree that theoretical knowledge is not as valuable as expected?

Nowadays, more and more young people graduate, and then they start their first job in society. However, whether the theoretical knowledge students learned in universit~~y~~**ies** can lead them to success is a controversial issue. I agree with that theories ~~is~~**are** not as valuable as most people expected.

It is obvious that most majors require a lot of practice and internship experiences before entering the workforce in society, especially ~~type of~~ engineering. Such as software engineering, companies recruit graduates to develop applications in variety of areas, this ~~work need~~**requires** employee to code the whole program to construct the application. In this scenario, theoretical knowledge is insufficient for people to finish the real work. Thus, practice is more important than theories ~~learning~~.

~~On top of that~~ **Furthermore/Moreover, it can also be argue that** the theoretical knowledge that students learned from books in **the** university was easy to be out of date. There is a long run for publication about theories, but it is necessary for students to find a good job by following the ~~newest~~**latest/cutting edge** technology. Therefore, students learn more about their major from the internet instead of books in class. Particularly in artificial intelligence, companies currently recruit graduates that have ~~exploration~~ **hands-on** experience on large language models ~~(like~~, ChatGPT~~)~~, it~~'~~ **i**s hard for students **learn** learn ~~about~~ from university.

**However/On the other hand**

Thus, students can understand and know how to use their knowledge impressively.

**gain a deeper understanding of how to apply their knowledge into practice**

~~Overall~~**In conclusion**, I agree with that theoretical knowledge is not as valuable as most people expected. It is necessary for students to learn theories in different majors, but practice is more important for everyone to find the ~~satisfacted~~**satisfying** job.

---

It seems to be a concern that some ex-prisoners commit crimes after being released from the prison. There are several causes of this trend, but measures could be taken to tackle the problem.

There are two main reasons that are responsible for this. One important factor contributing to this phenomenon is that ex-prisoners commit crimes under discrimination and lack of skills to work in society after being released from the prison. It is necessary for people to get legitimate source of income for make a living by working, but it is hard for them to re-entry into the society with stereotype to find a job. Another reason account for this trend is poverty trap. Living in previous community after serving a prison sentence, the terrible environment exposed ex-prisoners to a life of crime, so they fall in the poverty trap and can not get away from this kind of life. Therefore, some ex-prisoners commit crimes again.

Both the government and society should be actively involved to prevent the exprisoners re-commit crimes. The government should release some policies to deterrent crimes and strength the mental education for prisoners in prison. Besides, it is important to make publicity the effect of rehabilitation in prison, which can decrease the stereotype of people. Furthermore, prison managers can construct a re-entry program that provide vocational training for prisoners to teach them work skills to increase the chances of get new job after release.

In conclusion, there are two main reasons for some ex-prisoners make crimes again after release about social stigma and poverty trap. Therefore, the government and society should make publicity of rehabilitation and provide vocational training for them to prevent relevant consequences.

* Some people suggest that young adults should be encouraged to do some unpaid work for a period of time for the community to help people.
* Does it bring more benefits or drawbacks to the community and the young people?

Nowadays, more and more youth are encouraged to do some free work for community to help others. However, whether the young people do some unpaid work bring more benefits is a controversial issue. I agree with that youth freely help people can bring benefits to themselves and society.

It is obvious that more and more people are socializing less than before, the relationship between people and neighborhoods are decreasing now. Thus, it is a simple but effective way for young people to help others to make new friends in community, then they could bond with each other during the association. The people who helped others can receive feedback of helping from them, it is an essential part of a friendly community.

Furthermore, it can also be argue that helping neighborhoods is not just a form of work but more of a leisure activity for young people. Because they can release themselves from the heavy work when they helping others after daily work, it is important for society to full of energy. Besides, people also get a sense of achievement and inner satisfaction by helping others, it is a valuable experience of improvement.

On the other hand, although it is cost-consuming for young people to do unpaid work to help others rather than focus on their work or study, they can get more than money in other aspects, such as contacts, inner feeling and so on.

In conclusion, young people doing some unpaid work can bring benefits like making new friends and being more relax. Therefore, I argue that young adults should freely do some work for a period of time for the community to help others.
